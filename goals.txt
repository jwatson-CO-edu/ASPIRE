Goals
1. Re-write code outside 'magpie' repository to consolidate the relevant parts.
2. Determine how to integrate haptic sensing, which involves the force applied to the gripper.
3. Find out how to collect image and haptic data from the robot as it is manipulated.
    - Perhaps this just involves taking a static image, moving the robot to the appropriate configuration.
    - Applying a certain algorithm to drop the box and grab onto it, lifting it up.
